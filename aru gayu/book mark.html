<h1 id="demo1"> 1:Korean food </h1>
<img src="food.jpg">
<p>Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in Korea and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine reflects a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, vegetables, seafood and (at least in South Korea) meats. Dairy is largely absent from the traditional Korean diet.[3] Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of side dishes (반찬; 飯饌; banchan) that accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Kimchi is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include sesame oil, doenjang (fermented bean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, gochugaru (pepper flakes), gochujang (fermented red chili paste) and napa cabbage.

Ingredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes have become national. Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural etiquette.

 . Kongguksu, a cold noodle dish with a broth made from ground soy beans.
 . Tangpyeongchae, a dish made with nokdumuk (a mung bean starch jelly) and vegetables.
 . Koreans enjoying grilled meat and alcohol in the 18th century.
 . Marinated galbi before grilling.
 Joseon period
Agricultural innovations were significant and widespread during this period, such as the invention of the rain gauge during the 15th century. During 1429, the government began publishing books on agriculture and farming techniques, which included Nongsa jikseol (literally "Straight Talk on Farming"), an agricultural book compiled under King Sejong.[10][11][12]

A series of invasions in the earlier half of the Joseon caused a dynamic shift in the culture during the second half of the period. Groups of silhak ("practical learning") scholars began to emphasize the importance of looking outside the country for innovation and technology to help improve the agricultural systems. Crops traded by Europeans from the New World began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and the Philippines; these crops included maize, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and squash. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were previously unused.[13]

Government further developed agriculture through technology and lower taxation. Complex irrigation systems built by government allowed peasant farmers to produce larger crop volumes and produce crops not only for sustenance but also as cash crops. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment.[14]

The end of the Joseon period was marked by consistent encouragement to trade with the Western world, China and Japan. In the 1860s, trade agreements pushed by the Japanese government led the Joseon dynasty to open its trade ports with the west, and to numerous treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries.[15]

The opening of Korea to the Western world brought further exchange of culture and food. Western missionaries introduced new ingredients and dishes to Korea. Joseon elites were introduced to these new foods by way of foreigners who attended the royal court as advisers or physicians. This period also saw the introduction of various seasonings imported from Japan via western traders and alcoholic drinks from China.[16]Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change.

<p>Christians especially Mar Thoma Nasranis (St Thomas Christians), of Kerala have their own cuisine which is a blend of Indian, Middle Eastern and Western styles and flavours of cooking. Particularly well-developed are the snacks and savouries of Christians such as "achappam" and "kuzhalappam". A favourite dish of Kerala Christians is "mappas", or chicken stew. For this dish, chicken, potatoes and onions are simmered gently in a creamy white sauce flavoured with black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green chillies, lime juice, shallots and coconut milk. In Central Kerala this is made only with Beef or lamb, the usage of Chicken in stew is very rare. Lamb and duck can replace chicken in the stew recipe. Biriyani (mutton, chicken, Beef, lamb or prawn) made as ‘dum’ tops the list of delicacies. Thalassery Biriyani the only version of biriyani in Kerala.

Other dishes include piralen (chicken stir-fries), meat thoran (dry curry with shredded coconut), sardine and duck curries, and meen molee (spicy stewed fish). This is eaten with parotta or appam. "Meen Mulakittathu" or "Meen vevichathu" (fish in fiery red chilly sauce) is another favourite item.

In addition to chicken and fish, Christians along with a section of Hindus and all Muslims in Kerala eat red meat. "Irachi ularthiathu" is a beef dish cooked with spices.

<img src="momm.jpg" height="300px">
<p>Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail (Malayalam: [മുഹമ്മദ് കുട്ടി പനിപ്പറമ്പിൽ ഇസ്മായിൽ], Malayalam pronunciation: [muhɐmːɐd̪ kuʈːi pɐnɐpːɐrɐmbil ismɐi̯l]; born 7 September 1951), known mononymously by the hypocorism Mammootty ([mɐmːuːʈːi]), is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Malayalam and Tamil language films. He has also appeared in Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a career spanning five decades, he has appeared in more than 410 films, predominantly in lead roles. He is the recipient of several accolades, including three National Film Awards, nine Kerala State Film Awards, eleven Kerala Film Critics Awards and thirteen Filmfare Awards South. For his contribution to film, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri in 1998. In 2022, he was honoured with Kerala Prabha Award, the second-highest honour given by the Government of Kerala.

Mammootty made his debut in acting through Malayalam film Anubhavangal Paalichakal in 1971. His first leading role was in I. V. Sasi's unreleased film Devalokam (1979). Mammootty's breakthrough came in 1981 when he received the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor for his performance in Ahimsa. Major commercial successes during this time included the 1983 films Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu and Aa Raathri. Following a series of box office failures, the 1987 crime thriller New Delhi improved his commercial prospects. The films that followed through the next decade established Mammootty as one of the leading stars of Malayalam cinema.

The 2000s were a period of critical and commercial success for Mammootty. His performance in the Hindi and English-language bilingual biopic Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar (2000) won him the National Film Award for Best Actor, and he won Kerala State Film Awards for Kaazcha (2004) and Paleri Manikyam (2009). He garnered further critical praise for the satire Pranchiyettan & the Saint (2010), drama Varsham (2014), period drama Pathemari (2015) and black comedy Unda (2019), and received Filmfare Awards for Best Actor for the first three. His highest-grossing releases include the action comedy Madhura Raja (2019), the action thriller Bheeshma Parvam (2022), and the crime thriller Kannur Squad (2023).[1][2][3]

Mammootty is the chairman of Malayalam Communications, which runs the Malayalam television channels Kairali TV, Kairali News and Kairali We. He is the owner of multiple production ventures, including the distribution-production banner Playhouse and the Mammootty Kampany.Mammootty made his onscreen debut as an extra in K. S. Sethumadhavan’s Anubhavangal Paalichakal (1971) at the age of 20.[14] He made his second appearance in an uncredited role in the 1973 film Kaalachakram, directed by K. Narayanan. He was cast in a small role as a boatman.[15] It was in this film that he said his first dialogue.[16] In 1975, he acted in the theatre drama Sabarmathi.[17] After his graduation from Maharaja’s college in 1976, Mammootty began his practice as a lawyer in Manjeri. During this time, he met his mentor[18] M. T. Vasudevan Nair, who cast him in a pivotal role in Devalokam (1979).[19] However, due to financial constraints and conflicts among cast and crew, the film stopped shooting halfway. As the film did not get a release Vasudevan Nair cast him in a minor role in Vilkkanundu Swapnangal (1980), directed by Azad and scripted by Nair, his first credited role.[20]

During the filming of Vilkkanundu Swapnangal, Mammootty met and got closer to Sreenivasan. When K. G. George was looking for a newcomer with a “smart and handsome personality” as a daredevil motorcycle jumper for his film Mela (1980), Sreenivasan suggested Mammooty's name while they were shooting at the Raymon circus at Ernakulam.[21] Mela was the first Malayalam film to feature him in a prominent role. He was then cast in a supporting role in Vijayachithra Combines’ big budget action film Sphodanam (1981), directed by P. G. Vishwambharan. He was credited as "Sajin" in the film as Vishwanbharan felt that the name "Mammootty" did not suit an actor.[22] The same year, he made his first-ever appearance as a lead actor in the Malayalam film Thrishna (1981), which won the Filmfare Award for Best Film. Later that year, he appeared in a supporting role in I. V. Sasi’s political film Ahimsa (1981), which earned him the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor.[23]

The next year, he starred alongside Bharath Gopy in K. G. George’s epoch making Yavanika (1982), as a police inspector who is on the search for an unpopular tabla player of a travelling drama group who suddenly disappears.[24] Jijo Punnoose experimented Mammootty in a negative role in the epic period drama Padayottam (1982).[25] I. V. Sasi cast him in a pivotal role in John Jaffer Janardhanan (1982), the Malayalam remake of Manmohan Desai’s Hindi film Amar Akbar Anthony (1977). He was then cast in a major supporting role in Sasi’s political drama Ee Nadu (1982), which was a major commercial success, becoming the highest grossing South Indian film of the year.[26] Mammootty played supporting roles in most of the films released during the year. He had 23 of his films released during the year.[27]

1983–1986: Experimentation and breakthrough
In 1983, he started to transition into leading roles. Balu Kiriyath experimented with Mammootty by casting him as the lead in the comedy drama Visa, which was declared a hit at the box office.[28] In his next film, Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu, directed by P. G. Vishwambaran, he played the role of a libertine lawyer who takes up the case of a female physician who is charged with medical negligence. The film became a major commercial success, running for 250 days in theatres. A critic of The Indian Express wrote, "Seema, as Dr. Bala gives a stand out performance, being particularly impressive in highly emotional sequences. She is matched in acting by Mammootty, who is advocate Jayamohan."[29] In 2017, The Times of India described Mammootty's role as one of the "astounding advocate roles he has given life to".[30] Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu is credited with solidifying Mammootty's status as a leading man.[31] He then starred in Vishwambaran's Pinnilavu, a film about a fight of ethics between a father and son. A multi starrer, it was also a commercial success, running for 150 days in theatres.[31] He then appeared in a supporting role in K. G. George's controversial classic Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback. In the film, Mammootty plays the role of a film superstar, a character modelled after Prem Nazir. On 15 May 1983, Sreedhar Pillai of India Today wrote, "Mammootty, the current rage of the Malayalam screen, successfully apes the mannerisms of fellow actor Prem Nazir in his Prem Sagar role."[32]

He then starred as an antihero in P. Padmarajan's classic Koodevide. In the film, he plays the role of a jealous and possessive lover of a boarding school teacher. The film was a major commercial success. His pairing with Suhasini was very successful and was continued in films like Ente Upasana (1984). Koodevide was also selected for screening in that year's Indian Panorama. It also won the Kerala State Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value.[33] He then collaborated with director Joshiy for the first time for Aa Raathri.[34] Despite mixed critical response, it was a commercial success. It had a very successful soundtrack, credited with launching Ilaiyaraaja's Malayalam film career.[35] Critics consider Aa Rathri to be a trendsetter. It is regarded to be the first of the Kutty Petty films, tear-jerker family-drama tragedy of the 1980s. Films of this genre typically featured a happy family in the beginning, with a well-placed husband-cum-father, a young mother and a girl child of the age of 3 or 4. In the end, the family gets into a whirlpool of relationship problems.[36] Other notable releases of the year were supporting roles in Fazil's Eettillam and I. V. Sasi's political Iniyenkilum. Reviewing Iniyenkilum for India Today, Sreedhar Pillai wrote, "Mammootty easily outshines everyone else as the villainous politician."[37]

In 1984, he starred as the smuggler Tharadas in I. V. Sasi's Athirathram. The film achieved considerable commercial success and the character of Tharadas gained a cult following among the youth. Mammootty, who was considered a bankable leading actor was propelled to superstardom with the success of the film. Owing to the popularity of the character, it was reprised by Mammootty in Balram vs Tharadas (2006).[38] He then starred in I. V. Sasi's Kanamarayathu, an adaptation of the 1912 novel Daddy-Long-Legs by Jean Webster. In the film he plays the role of the sole successor of a rich business empire who falls for an orphan girl younger than him. Kanamarayathu explores the concept of relationships between couples with a large disparity in their ages, which challenged Indian social mores. Upon release the film received critical acclaim and became a commercial success.[39] For his performance as Roy Varghese, Mammootty won his first Kerala Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor.[40] The film has over the years accumulated a cult following and is now considered a classic in Malayalam cinema.[41] He then starred as a police officer in Bharathan's Ithiri Poove Chuvannapoove. The film explores the relationship between a police officer and his younger brother, who becomes a Naxalite. It was a critical success and had a successful soundtrack.[42]

He then appeared in a supporting role in the art house film, Akkare. In the film he portrays a non resident Malayali. The film is a satirical take on the obsession, especially of the middle class of other's lifestyle.[43] He then starred as a vengeful fisherman back from prison in I. V. Sasi's Adiyozhukkukal. The film was a commercial and critical success. Mammootty won his first Kerala State Film Award for Best Actor and his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Malayalam for his performance as Karunan.[33] Mammootty's performance in the film is often considered one of the best in his early career. The film was produced by Casino Productions, a production company owned by Century Kochumon, Mohanlal, I. V. Sasi, and Mammootty.[44] He also starred in I. V. Sasi's Aalkkoottathil Thaniye, a box office hit. In 1988, film scholar Vasanthi Shankaranarayanan wrote, "Aalkkottathil Thaniye shows the changing image of woman in contemporary Malayalam cinema. From weak and enslaved to strong and independent."[45] Aalkkottathil Thaniye, the screenplay was released as a book by DC Books in 2009.[46] That year he also starred in several Kutty Petty films that received negative critical reviews but were successful at the box office, notable of which were Sandarbham, Koottinilamkili and Chakkarayumma. The former of which was a major box office hit, running for 150 days in theatres. It was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The genre had now become synonymous with Mammootty, being renamed the Mammootty-Kutty-Petty film.[47]

The following year, he starred in Padmarajan's Thinkalaazhcha Nalla Divasam, based on the radio drama Ammaykku Vendi by Sajini Pavithran, in which he plays the role of a man who wants to sell his ancestral house and put his mother in an old age home. The film explores the layers of family relationship in a rural setting threatened by urban culture and explains how the imminent breakdown of the joint family is prevented by a death. Upon release, the film was critically acclaimed, winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Malayalam that year. He then starred in I. V. Sasi's Anubandham, scripted by M. T. Vasudevan Nair, the film was released to widespread critical acclaim, winning four Kerala State Film Awards that year. He collaborated with Nair and Sasi once again that year with Idanilangal.

He then, starred as Ravi Varma, a millionaire on death row for killing his wife in Joshiy's Nirakkoottu. The film was a major critical and commercial success, becoming one of the highest grossing films of that year.[48] The film won the Filmfare Award for Best Malayalam film.[49] He then starred as a forest officer who is mistaken for a Naxalite, arrested and jailed for many years in Balu Mahendra's romantic drama Yathra. The film tells a fictional story but is built upon the human rights violations by the police and the prison authorities in India during the emergency of 1975–1977, when the fundamental rights of the citizens were suspended. It is an adaptation of the 1977 Japanese classic The Yellow Handkerchief.[50] The film was released to widespread critical acclaim, winning the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value. It was declared a blockbuster, running for 200 days in theatres,[51] becoming the highest grossing Malayalam film of the year.[52] For his performance, Mammootty won the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Yathra, as well as a Special Jury Award for his performances in both Yathra and Nirakkoottu.[53][54]

In 1986 alone, he acted in about 35 films, including a brief appearance in Mazha Peyyunnu Maddalam Kottunnu. In 1986, he teamed up with I. V. Sasi for the film Aavanazhi, which was written by T. Damodaran. Mammootty appears in the lead role as Balram, a police officer. Both Inspector Balram and Balram vs. Tharadas are sequels to this film. The film was a huge hit at the box office. The film ran for over 200 days. The film was remade in Tamil, Telugu, and Hindi.[55][56]

1987–1990
Following a series of flops, Mammootty found commercial success with the crime thriller New Delhi (1987), directed by Joshiy and written by Dennis Joseph.[57] He played G.

A critic from Rediff labelled the film as his "magnum opus", citing that he is "perfect" and that the film for him is a "justified triumph".[42] Similarly, critics cited Suriya's performance as "outstanding" and claimed that the film "works because of his performance", whilst other reviewers claimed the film was an "out and out Suriya show".[43][44] His portrayals also fetched him several notable awards, including his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil, a Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize and the Vijay Award for Best Actor for 2008.[45] The film also went on to receive a National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil for 2008.[46]

The film ran 100 days in 3 states (Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh). Ayan was the highest-grossing Tamil film of 2009.[49][50]
