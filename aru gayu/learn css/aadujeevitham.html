    <p>Najeeb Muhammad, a young man from Arattupuzha in Haripad of the Kerala state, is newly married and dreams of a better work in any of the Persian Gulf states. After several endeavors, he finally gets an opportunity to work in Saudi Arabia. However, at the King Khalid International Airport, Riyadh he is clueless as what to do next and is taken away by an Arab man who he believes to be his Arbab. The Arbab takes him to a cattle farm in the middle of a desert, confirming Najeeb's worst nightmare. The Arbab hands Najeeb over to the farm supervisor.

        Najeeb is then used as a slave laborer and shepherd and is assigned to tend goats, sheep and camels for almost 3+1 years in the remote deserts of Saudi Arabia. He is forced to do backbreaking work, kept half-hungry and is denied water to wash and suffers unimaginably. The farm's brutal supervisor keeps Najeeb in control with a gun and binoculars and frequently beats him with a belt. And now Najeeb had to manage this new fate without the bare human essentials.
        
       <span class="pp">In a country where he doesn't know the language, places or people, he is far away from any human interaction. Najeeb steadily starts to identify himself with the goats. He considers himself as one of them. His dreams, desires, avenges and hopes starts to fade away as his mindset has now become similar to that of the goats. He talks to them, eats with them, sleeps with them and virtually lives the life of a goat. Although he has tried absconding multiple times, the supervisor catches him every time and punishes him by denying him food and water. He stops absconding when he finds the skeleton of the previous shepherd buried in the sand, who he thought had escaped. Even then, he keeps a ray of hope which will bring freedom and end to his sufferings some day.
        
        Finally one night with the help of Ibrahim Khadiri, a Somalian worker in the neighboring farm, Najeeb Muhammed and his friend Hakeem escapes from the horrible life to freedom. But, the trio fumbles across the desert for days, and young Hakeem dies of thirst and fatigue. But Ibrahim Khadiri and Najeeb keep moving on and the stumble across an Oasis where they manage to take rest for a few days. In the day they had planned to start moving again, Ibrahim disappears leaving Najeeb alone. Initially devastated, Najeeb somehow manages to find his way to a nearby highway, where after a day of trying, a kind Arab stops for him and rides him to Al-Bathaa.</span> 
        
        Over there, he meets Kunjikka, a fellow malayali who helps refugees. Kunjikka nurses him back to health and finally calls back to his hometown. Once Najeeb started feeling better, he gets himself arrested by the civil police in order to get deported to India with Hameed, who he had met while being with Kunjikka. Najeeb gets detained in the Sumesi Prison, where arbabs get to visit and take any of the absconded prisoners that worked for them back to their company. Initially Najeeb and Hameed were afraid of their arbabs showing up, but they were detained for months without any issue, until Hameed's arbab appeared and took Hameed away with him. Soon enough, Najeeb's arbab walked in but amazingly he doesn't take Najeeb with him. Relieved, Najeeb thinks that the arbab didn't recognize him until a friendly warden tells him that the arbab didn't have Najeeb's visa, else he would have dragged Najeeb back to the cattle farm. Najeeb realizes that he was kidnapped at the airport and used as a slave, while the visa was for some other job at some other company.
        
        In a few weeks, he gets to know that he is being deported to India by the Saudi Arabian authorities. Feeling ecstatic he bids his goodbye's to his fellow inmates and as he boards the plane with several deportees, he realizes how everyone is being herded inside the plane like a couple goats and how he has lived a goat's life.</p>
